# Dot_matrix_Control_Tutorial-
We discuss how to use Arduino Uno or Mega along with two 74HC595 shift registers to drive and control the display of an 8X8 dot matrix display. This tutorial includes:
1. A nontechnical discussion of the 74HC595 shift register and explains its various modes of operations. 
2. Explanation of how to use two registers to control drive the rows and columns of the 8X8 display. 
3. Explanation of synchronous communication with the registers with code segments. 
4. A method for designing 8X8 patterns using Excel. 
5. Arduino C programs for displaying static as well as animated designs. 
6. Details of the motivation behind the programs. 
7. Schematics and circuit diagrams.
